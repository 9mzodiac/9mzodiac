## Hi, I'm Zodiac!

I'm an engineer with 10+ years of experience working as a fullstack developer. I'm passionate about P2P ( peer to peer ) apps, post-blockchain technologies, and ethical crypto. My path involves an intersection of technology, engineering, and music. At heart, I'm a product designer and only seek to build what I would use solve real problems I relate to.
